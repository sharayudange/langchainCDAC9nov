# Exercise: Configuring Language Models and Prompts

## Objective
To practice configuring language models (Cohere, Groq) and creating prompt templates to generate a story.

## Instructions
Follow the steps below:

1. **Create `actor_picker` Function**:
   - Write a function named `actor_picker()` that randomly returns an actor's name. You can use Python's random generator to select an actor.

2. **Create `location_picker` Function**:
   - Write a function named `location_picker()` that randomly returns the name of a location.

3. **Create `theme_picker` Function**:
   - Write a function named `theme_picker()` that randomly returns a theme.

4. **Configure and Use Cohere Model**:
   - Set up the Cohere model using `ChatCohere`.
   - Create a prompt template that generates a story centered around the chosen **Actor**, **Location**, and **Theme** using the Cohere model.
   - Print the detailed story output from the model.

5. **Configure and Use Groq Model**:
   - Set up the Groq model using `ChatGroq`.
   - Create a prompt template to generate a story using the Groq model.
   - Print the detailed response from the model.
     
6. **Add InMemoryChatMessageHistory to store conversation**:
   - Use 'InMemoryChatMessageHistory', to store history and allow user customize the story.
   - You can pass the story created with prompt saying 'change the given story according to user input'.

6. **Execution**:
   - When you run the code, it should randomly pick an actor, location, and theme, then generate a story around these elements. Then it should ask for user input to customize the story. You may include heroines in the story for added detail.

## Example Output

### Selected Elements
- **Actor**: Chris Evans
- **Location**: New York
